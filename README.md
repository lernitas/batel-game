# Epic Battles with Lernitas and Zorksees

Welcome to the thrilling world of **Lernitas** and **Zorksees**, where strategic battles meet dynamic price movements! Dive into this immersive experience where your tokens become warriors, and your strategies decide the spoils of war.

## Gameplay Overview:

### 1. Collateral and Leverage

- **Collateral Use:** Players use Lernitas or Zorksees as collateral for a simulated 100x leveraged position on either Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL). This high leverage amplifies price movements, creating an intense and engaging battle scenario.
- **Safe Simulation:** Despite the dramatic price movements, you don't risk losing your actual tokens. The leverage and battles are entirely within the game’s mechanics.

### 2. Battle Mechanics

- **Attack and Defend:**
  - **Attack (Short):**
    - **Lernitas** attack by shorting SOL.
    - **Zorksees** attack by shorting ETH.
  - **Defend (Long):**
    - **Lernitas** defend by going long on ETH.
    - **Zorksees** defend by going long on SOL.
- **Warrior Conversion:** The UI translates your positions into "warriors." For instance, $100 worth of tokens gives you 300 warriors (valued at $0.03 per warrior).

### 3. Warrior Dynamics

- **Price Movements:** The fluctuating prices of ETH and SOL dynamically adjust your number of warriors:
  - **Profits** add reinforcements (more warriors).
  - **Losses** result in casualties (fewer warriors).
- **Final Count Impact:** While the number of warriors can change during the battle, the primary factor in determining rewards is not the final count of your warriors but the **Glory Points (GP)** you have staked.

### 4. Treasury Contributions

- **Losing Penalty:** If your side loses, 1% of your collateral is transferred to the treasury.
- **Governance Use:** These funds support the liquidity pool or other governance-determined purposes.

### 5. Additional Generals

- **Reinforcements:** Players can send more generals (additional tokens) into battle at any time to strengthen their positions.
- **Temporary Warriors:** Warriors are temporary and only last for the duration of the battle. However, generals are returned post-battle, minus the 1% treasury contribution if defeated.

## War Bonds and Glory Points (GP):

### 1. War Bonds and Their Role in Battle

- **Purchasing War Bonds:**
  - War Bonds can be bought from the treasury using USDC at any point during the battle.
  - These funds collected from War Bond purchases form the prize pool that will be distributed to the victorious side.
  - A 2% tax is applied to each War Bond purchase. This tax revenue is allocated to the treasury, with its usage determined by governance decisions.
- **Pricing Mechanics:**
  - Initial pricing starts at a favorable ratio of 300:1 against the value of your collateral (Lernitas or Zorksees).
  - As the battle progresses, the cost of War Bonds **increases**. By the last hour of battle, the ratio will shift to 10:1, making late-stage purchases more expensive.
- **Strategic Timing:**
  - **Early Purchases** allow you to secure larger GP stakes at a lower cost.
  - **Late Purchases** are more costly but allow for informed decisions based on the battle’s progression, preventing large players from easily manipulating outcomes in the final stages.

### 2. Coverage and Strategy

- **War Bonds Coverage:** These bonds cover the value of your warriors. As your army grows, either through adding more collateral or market appreciation, you may need to buy additional War Bonds.
- **Collateral Value Impact:**
  - If the **market value of your collateral decreases**, the War Bond covers a larger percentage of your warriors.
  - If the **collateral value increases** (due to price appreciation or additional tokens), the War Bond covers fewer warriors.
- **Example:** Sending $100 worth of Zorksees initially allows you to buy a War Bond for $0.333. As time progresses, the price increases, so purchasing in the final hour could cost $10 or more, depending on market conditions.

### 3. Glory Points (GP)

- **Staking via War Bonds:** Purchasing War Bonds allows you to stake the value of your warriors as GP, essential for determining your share of the spoils.
- **Initial GP Staking:** The GP reflects the value of your collateral at the time of War Bond purchase, providing a baseline for your GP.
- **Earning More GP:** As your leveraged position improves, you can accumulate more GP by staking additional value when your position is favorable.

### 4. Dynamic GP Staking

- **Real-Time Staking:** Throughout the battle, you can stake the current value of your warriors to lock in GP at any moment.
- **Increasing Value:** If your position improves and you gain reinforcements, you can stake these new gains as GP, securing additional value.
- **Secure Gains:** Once staked, GP remains locked in and is not reduced by subsequent losses in battle.
- **Strategic Monitoring:** This encourages players to strategically monitor and stake GP during profitable periods. Even if your warriors perish, timely GP staking during favorable conditions can yield significant rewards.

## Spoils of War

- **Prize Pool Distribution:** Funds raised from War Bond purchases form the prize pool, awarded to the winning side at the end of each weekly battle epoch.
- **Claiming Rewards:** Players must stake GP to claim a portion of the spoils. The distribution is based on the GP each player has accumulated, rewarding those with higher stakes.
- **Winning Determination:** The side with the most GP staked wins the battle. The distribution of spoils is then shared among the winning team members, based on their individual GP stakes.
- **Timely Claims:** Spoils must be claimed within 24 hours after the battle ends, or they roll over to the next distribution period.

## Skill-Based Mechanics

### 1. Strategic Decision-Making

- **Market Predictions:** Success in battle relies on accurately predicting the market movements of ETH and SOL. A player who correctly anticipates these movements can significantly increase their warrior count and GP.
  - **Example:** A player who defends (longs) ETH during a bull market will see their position grow stronger, gaining reinforcements and opportunities to stake more GP.
- **Leverage Utilization:** The 100x leverage amplifies both gains and losses. Skillful players who understand market trends and timing can leverage this to their advantage, potentially outperforming larger players who make less effective decisions.

### 2. Timing and GP Staking

- **Dynamic Staking:** Players can lock in GP at any point during the battle, which means that smaller players with well-timed stakes can outperform larger players who may have more initial collateral but less strategic timing.
  - **Example:** A smaller player who stakes GP during a favorable market swing will secure their gains, even if their position later turns unfavorable. A larger player, however, who stakes late and at a higher War Bond cost may not secure as much GP relative to their investment.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Early War Bond purchases offer a cost advantage. Players who can predict market trends and buy War Bonds early at lower prices will have more GP for their investment, outpacing larger players who purchase War Bonds at higher costs later.

### 3. Skill vs. Wealth

- **Leveraged Outcomes:** The game’s leveraged positions mean that market movements can dramatically alter the value of a player’s warriors. A smaller player with a well-chosen position that aligns with market movements can achieve higher GP than a larger player whose position moves unfavorably.
  - **Example:** A whale deposits $1,000 worth of Zorksees to attack (short) ETH. If ETH’s price rises, their position is weakened, and they lose warriors. Conversely, a smaller player with $100 of Zorksees defending (long) ETH gains reinforcements and can stake more GP.
- **Anti-Whale Mechanics:** The increasing cost of War Bonds over time discourages whales from making late-game large investments to manipulate outcomes. They would need to spend significantly more to cover their warriors and stake GP effectively.

### 4. Monitoring and Adapting

- **Real-Time Engagement:** The game rewards players who actively monitor the market and adjust their strategies in real-time. This ongoing engagement allows for better decision-making and timely GP staking.
  - **Example:** A player who actively tracks ETH and SOL price movements can lock in GP during peak favorable conditions, securing a stronger position in the prize distribution.

Prepare for a unique blend of strategic positioning and dynamic market engagement in the world of **Lernitas** and **Zorksees**! Whether you’re a small player with sharp market instincts or a large player with substantial resources, your success hinges on your ability to predict, adapt, and strategically stake your positions.
