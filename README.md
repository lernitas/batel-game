# Epic Battles with Lernitas and Zorksees

Welcome to the thrilling world of **Lernitas** and **Zorksees**, where strategic battles meet dynamic price movements! Dive into this immersive experience where your tokens become warriors, and your strategies decide the spoils of war.

## Gameplay Overview:

### 1. Collateral and Leverage

- **Collateral Use:** Players use Lernitas or Zorksees as collateral for a simulated 100x leveraged position on either Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL). This high leverage amplifies price movements, creating an intense and engaging battle scenario.
- **Safe Simulation:** Despite the dramatic price movements, you don't risk losing your actual tokens. The leverage and battles are entirely within the game’s mechanics.

### 2. Battle Mechanics

- **Attack and Defend:**
  - **Attack (Short):**
    - **Lernitas** attack by shorting SOL.
    - **Zorksees** attack by shorting ETH.
  - **Defend (Long):**
    - **Lernitas** defend by going long on ETH.
    - **Zorksees** defend by going long on SOL.
- **Warrior Conversion:** The UI translates your positions into "warriors." For instance, $100 worth of tokens gives you 300 warriors (valued at $0.03 per warrior).

### 3. Warrior Dynamics

- **Price Movements:** The fluctuating prices of ETH and SOL dynamically adjust your number of warriors:
  - **Profits** add reinforcements (more warriors).
  - **Losses** result in casualties (fewer warriors).
- **Final Count Impact:** While the number of warriors can change during the battle, the primary factor in determining rewards is not the final count of your warriors but the **Glory Points (GP)** you have staked.

### 4. Treasury Contributions

- **Losing Penalty:** If your side loses, 1% of your collateral is transferred to the treasury.
- **Governance Use:** These funds support the liquidity pool or other governance-determined purposes.

### 5. Additional Generals

- **Reinforcements:** Players can send more generals (additional tokens) into battle at any time to strengthen their positions.
- **Temporary Warriors:** Warriors are temporary and only last for the duration of the battle. However, generals are returned post-battle, minus the 1% treasury contribution if defeated.

## War Bonds and Glory Points (GP):

### 1. War Bonds and Their Role in Battle

- **Purchasing War Bonds:**
  - War Bonds can be bought from the treasury using USDC at any point during the battle.
  - These funds collected from War Bond purchases form the prize pool that will be distributed to the victorious side.
  - A 2% tax is applied to each War Bond purchase. This tax revenue is allocated to the treasury, with its usage determined by governance decisions.
- **Pricing Mechanics:**
  - Initial pricing starts at a favorable ratio of 300:1 against the value of your collateral (Lernitas or Zorksees).
  - As the battle progresses, the cost of War Bonds **increases**. By the last hour of battle, the ratio will shift to 10:1, making late-stage purchases more expensive.
- **Strategic Timing:**
  - **Early Purchases** allow you to secure larger GP stakes at a lower cost.
  - **Late Purchases** are more costly but allow for informed decisions based on the battle’s progression, preventing large players from easily manipulating outcomes in the final stages.

### 2. Coverage and Strategy

- **War Bonds Coverage:** These bonds cover the value of your warriors. As your army grows, either through adding more collateral or market appreciation, you may need to buy additional War Bonds.
- **Collateral Value Impact:**
  - If the **market value of your collateral decreases**, the War Bond covers a larger percentage of your warriors.
  - If the **collateral value increases** (due to price appreciation or additional tokens), the War Bond covers fewer warriors.
- **Example:** Sending $100 worth of Zorksees initially allows you to buy a War Bond for $0.333. As time progresses, the price increases, so purchasing in the final hour could cost $10 or more, depending on market conditions.

### 3. Glory Points (GP)

- **Staking via War Bonds:** Purchasing War Bonds allows you to stake the value of your warriors as GP, essential for determining your share of the spoils.
- **Initial GP Staking:** The GP reflects the value of your collateral at the time of War Bond purchase, providing a baseline for your GP.
- **Earning More GP:** As your leveraged position improves, you can accumulate more GP by staking additional value when your position is favorable.

### 4. Dynamic GP Staking

- **Real-Time Staking:** Throughout the battle, you can stake the current value of your warriors to lock in GP at any moment.
- **Increasing Value:** If your position improves and you gain reinforcements, you can stake these new gains as GP, securing additional value.
- **Secure Gains:** Once staked, GP remains locked in and is not reduced by subsequent losses in battle.
- **Strategic Monitoring:** This encourages players to strategically monitor and stake GP during profitable periods. Even if your warriors perish, timely GP staking during favorable conditions can yield significant rewards.

## Spoils of War

- **Prize Pool Distribution:** Funds raised from War Bond purchases form the prize pool, awarded to the winning side at the end of each weekly battle epoch.
- **Claiming Rewards:** Players must stake GP to claim a portion of the spoils. The distribution is based on the GP each player has accumulated, rewarding those with higher stakes.
- **Winning Determination:** The side with the most GP staked wins the battle. The distribution of spoils is then shared among the winning team members, based on their individual GP stakes.
- **Timely Claims:** Spoils must be claimed within 24 hours after the battle ends, or they roll over to the next distribution period.
