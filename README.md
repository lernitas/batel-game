# Game Concept: Epic Battles with Lernitas and Zorksees
Welcome to the thrilling world of Lernitas and Zorksees, where strategic battles meet dynamic price movements!

## Gameplay Overview:

In this game, players use their tokens (Lernitas or Zorksees) as collateral for high-leverage positions in a simulated environment involving Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL). Here’s how it works:

### 1. Collateral and Leverage:
* Players can send Lernitas or Zorksees into battle as collateral for a notional 100x leveraged position on either ETH or SOL.
* This leverage creates intense price action but does not impact your actual token holdings – no tokens are lost or gained directly due to price changes.

### 2. Battle Mechanisms:
* Attack (Short):
    * Lernitas attacking means shorting SOL.
    * Zorksees attacking means shorting ETH.
* Defend (Long):
    * Lernitas defending means going long on ETH.
    * Zorksees defending means going long on SOL.
      
* The game UI shows your position valued in "warriors" with each warrior being valued at $0.03. So $100 worth of tokens equals 300 warriors.

### 3. Warrior Dynamics:
* As the price of ETH and SOL fluctuates, the number of warriors in battle changes dynamically.
* Profits from price movements add reinforcements (more warriors), while losses result in casualties (fewer warriors).
* The warrior count throughout the entire game influences your share of the spoils of war.

### 4. Treasury Contributions:
* If your side loses, 1% of your collateral is transferred to the treasury.
* These funds are allocated to the liquidity pool or other purposes as decided by governance.

### 5. Additional Collateral:
* Players can send more generals (tokens) into the fray at any time to strengthen their position.
* Warriors are ephemeral and only last for the battle duration, but generals (collateral) are returned after the battle, except for the 1% contribution if defeated.

## War Bonds and Glory Points (GP):

To determine battle outcomes and rewards, players utilize War Bonds and Glory Points:

### 1. Purchasing War Bonds:
* War Bonds can be bought from the treasury at any time during the battle for USDC.
* The price starts at a ratio of 300:1 vs the value of your supplied collateral (lernitas/zorksees sent to battle) and decays every block, reaching 10:1 approximately an hour before the battle ends.
* Early or strategic purchasing of War Bonds can provide advantages.

### 2. Coverage and Strategy:
War Bonds are essential for covering the value of your warriors in battle. If you decide to send more generals (collateral) into the fray, you might need to purchase additional War Bonds to ensure full coverage of your expanding army.

Example: If you send $100 worth of Zorksees into battle, you can initially buy a War Bond for $0.333 or wait until the last hour of the battle when the cost could rise to $10, depending on market conditions and the decay rate.

* **Collateral Value Impact:**
    * If the market value of your collateral (Lernitas or Zorksees) decreases, the War Bond will cover a higher percentage of your warriors. This means if the collateral's price drops, your existing War Bond becomes more effective.
    * Conversely, if the value of your collateral increases (due to market price appreciation or by adding more tokens), the War Bond will cover fewer of your warriors. Thus, you might need to purchase more War Bonds to maintain full coverage as your collateral value grows.

### 3. Glory Points (GP):
* **War Bonds and GP:** War Bonds are crucial because they allow you to stake the value of your warriors in battle as GP. This staking is essential for determining your share of the spoils of war at the end of the battle.

* **Initial GP Staking:** When you purchase a War Bond, you stake the value of your collateral at that moment as GP. This initial GP amount reflects the value of your collateral tokens (Lernitas or Zorksees) at the time of purchase, providing a baseline for your GP.

* **Earning More GP:** As the battle progresses and your leveraged position improves, your warrior count can increase due to price movements. This growth allows you to stake more GP. Thus, purchasing a War Bond is just the starting point for accumulating GP – strategic staking during favorable market conditions can significantly enhance your GP.

### 4. Dynamic GP Staking:
* **Real-Time GP Staking:** Throughout the battle, you can monitor the value of your warriors and stake additional GP at any moment. This dynamic staking allows you to lock in GP based on the current value of your leveraged position.

* **Leveraged Position Increases:** If your position strengthens and you gain reinforcements (additional warriors), you can stake these new gains as GP, capitalizing on the profit and locking in more GP during the battle.

* **Position Declines:** If your position weakens and you lose warriors, your previously staked GP remains unaffected. Once staked, GP is secure regardless of subsequent losses in the battle.

* **Strategic Monitoring:** This mechanic encourages players to watch the battle closely and stake GP during profitable periods. Even if your warriors are eventually defeated, timely staking when your position is favorable can result in substantial GP accumulation. This strategic element ensures that even in defeat, you can secure a significant portion of the spoils by wisely managing and staking your GP.

## Battle Outcomes and Rewards:

### 1. Winning and Claiming Rewards:
* At the end of each weekly battle epoch, the side with the most GP wins and can claim the spoils of war.
* Rewards must be claimed within 24 hours, or they roll over to the next week’s distribution.
### 2. Dynamic and Strategic Gameplay:
* The dual-sided pricing mechanism, involving the market rate of Lernitas and Zorksees multiplied by your warriors in battle, creates an engaging and dynamic experience.
* Players must strategize on when to buy War Bonds, how to manage their leveraged positions, and when to send additional generals to battle.
* The ability to stake GP during profitable periods adds another layer of strategy and excitement to the game.
